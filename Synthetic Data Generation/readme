This folder contains two projects where I created synthetic datasets to mirror real-world data. The idea is to have realistic but safe-to-share data that can be reused in other projects without restrictions.

1. Synthetic Replication (Tabular)

Based on a real credit card fraud dataset.

Goal: Generate synthetic transactions that match the real data in amount distributions, class imbalance, and feature correlations.

Skills: manual data generation, statistical similarity tests (KS test, Wasserstein distance, MAE), correlation analysis, visualization.

2. Synthetic Time Series (Energy Consumption)

Based on household power consumption data.

Goal: Create a synthetic time series that captures trend, seasonality, and noise patterns of real energy usage.

Skills: time series simulation, autocorrelation and rolling statistics analysis, signal decomposition, comparison of real vs synthetic dynamics.

These projects are meant to be starting points synthetic datasets like these can later be plugged into machine learning, anomaly detection, or forecasting tasks while avoiding privacy issues.
