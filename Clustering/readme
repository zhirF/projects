This folder contains a collection of clustering projects built as part of my portfolio.  
The focus is on applying different clustering algorithms to well-known datasets, using clear workflows and visualizations.  

---

What’s inside
- End-to-end clustering workflows in Jupyter notebooks  
- Presentations (PDF/PPTX) summarizing each project in a clear, human-readable way  
- Common structure across projects: data preparation → parameter selection → clustering → visualization → evaluation  

---

Skills Demonstrated
- **Clustering methods**: K-Means, Agglomerative, DBSCAN, Spectral  
- **Model selection**: elbow method, silhouette score, dendrograms, eigengap  
- **Dimensionality reduction & visualization**: PCA, t-SNE, interactive charts  
- **Cluster evaluation**: silhouette, ARI, NMI, profiling of clusters  
- **Communication**: clear documentation and presentations

Summary
These projects show the ability to:
- Apply multiple clustering algorithms appropriately  
- Select parameters systematically rather than guessing  
- Visualize and interpret clusters in reduced dimensions  
- Communicate results effectively to both technical and non-technical audiences
