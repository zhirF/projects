This folder contains three machine learning projects where I applied Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) on the Breast Cancer dataset.

Each project has:

A Jupyter Notebook with clear step-by-step workflow

Visualizations for evaluation (confusion matrix, ROC curve, PR curve, learning curve, calibration curve)

A short presentation summarizing the method, results, and insights

Skills demonstrated

Data preprocessing & scaling

Model training & evaluation

Interpreting metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1, AUC)

Visualization of results for model comparison

Communicating findings in presentation format

These projects show how different algorithms perform on the same dataset and how to interpret their results in a clear, visual way.
