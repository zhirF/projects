King County Housing Dashboard

This project explores the King County housing market (Seattle area) using Tableau. The dataset covers ~21,000 house sales, including details like price, square footage, number of bedrooms, and location.

The dashboard lets you:

Explore housing prices across different zip codes (map view).

Compare house size with sale price using a scatter plot.

See how average prices vary with the number of bedrooms.

Look at how prices have changed over time.

It’s fully interactive — you can filter by zipcode, year built, or bedrooms to drill down into the data.

The goal was to create a clear, visual way to understand what drives housing prices and to practice interactive dashboard design in Tableau.
