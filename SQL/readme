This repository contains two SQL projects that demonstrate both data exploration and data cleaning.  
They are written in a simple, step-by-step style, similar to how I would approach real datasets.  

---

## COVID Data Exploration
- Explored global COVID cases, deaths, and vaccinations.  
- Compared countries (for example, Iraq vs Austria) and continents.  
- Used CTEs, temp tables, joins, and views to organize queries.  
- Looked at trends in reporting quality and the relationship between infection and vaccination rates.  

**Skills:** SQL joins, aggregations, CTEs, views, exploratory analysis

## Housing Data Cleaning (US)
- Took a raw housing dataset and prepared it for analysis.  
- Standardized date formats, filled missing values, split addresses, and normalized Yes/No flags.  
- Removed duplicates using ROW_NUMBER() and dropped unused columns.  
- Simulated a realistic ETL-style cleaning process.  

**Skills:** SQL data cleaning, normalization, deduplication, data preparation
